# Kinect-Showroom
Development of an application which connects the user with the computer in order to control the latter using gestures and postures without the need of any other input devices.Created for my thesis during my studies at the department of electronic computer systems engineering in Pireaus university of applied sciences.

In order run simply open the project using visual studio having the kinect succesfully installed into your windows os. Carefull because the kinect sensor cant be identidied by windows if the latter is running as a virtual machine.

This application implements some gesture techniques such as zoom in/out, pan, scroll and rotate using some sample text and pictures.
